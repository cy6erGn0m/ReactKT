# ReactKT

ReactKT aims to ease front end developpement using :
* [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org) language from JetBrains
* [ReactJS](https://facebook.github.io/react/) view building library
* [Material Design Lite](http://www.getmdl.io) as UI Component library

# Why ?

Mainly because I don't know Kotlin, nor React, nor Material Design. So, it's fun :)

# Status

*I DO NOT RECOMMAND TO USE THIS PROJECT IN PRODUCTION* _(yet...)_

I publish this as an initial & prototyping work. I'm currently unsatisfied by a lot of thing (API design, level of type safety)

Feedback and contribution are welcomes.

# How to test

There is another _Todo app_ in `sampleprojects/demo-core`.

Clone the repository. Launch `gradlew webdist`, then open `sampleprojects/demo-core/build/webdist/index.html` in your favorite browser.
